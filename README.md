# HealthCareApplication
 "I developed a Healthcare Management System using Spring Boot and Hibernate. This system helps manage healthcare operations, such as handling doctors, patients, and appointments. It allows users to perform CRUD operations for doctors, patients, and appointments. The goal is to streamline the management of healthcare data and make the scheduling of appointments more efficient."
