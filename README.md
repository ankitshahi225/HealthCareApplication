# HealthCareApplication
 "I developed a Healthcare Management System using Spring Boot and Hibernate. This system helps manage healthcare operations, such as handling doctors, patients, and appointments. It allows users to perform CRUD operations for doctors, patients, and appointments. The goal is to streamline the management of healthcare data and make the scheduling of appointments more efficient."



# Project Structure

* Controller Layer: Manages HTTP requests and sends responses.
* Service Layer: Contains business logic.
* Repository Layer: Interacts with the database via Hibernate.
* Entity Layer: Defines the structure of Doctor, Patient, and Appointment entities.

# **Features**

## Doctor Management:

* Add, update, view, and delete doctor details.

## Patient Management:

* Add, update, view, and delete patient records.

## Appointment Management:

* Schedule, update, view, and cancel appointments between doctors and patients.

## Data Consistency:

* Ensured through Hibernate (JPA), which links all data efficiently in the database.


# **API Endpoints**

##  Doctor APIs:

* **GET /api/doctors** – Get a list of all doctors.

* **POST /api/doctors** – Add a new doctor.

* **GET /api/doctors/{id}** – Get details of a specific doctor by ID.

* **PUT /api/doctors/{id}** – Update a doctor's information.
